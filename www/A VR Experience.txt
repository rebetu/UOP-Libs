A VR Experience
	Your computer science friend has allowed you the rare opportunity to experience a VR headset for a research project he is working on. He instructs you to put on the headset and close your eyes. You follow his instructions. A few moments later he gives you the okay to open your eyes. When you open your eyes, you see a vast ocean in front of you. You look around and see that you are on a sandy beach that seems to have no end. You look back at the ocean and see the sun setting in the horizon, which fills the sky with shades of [color] and [color]. As you admire the view, the surroundings suddenly fade to white for a moment. You are transported to an entirely new location, one with tall trees surrounding you.

As you look around to explore this forest further; you suddenly notice a giant [dinosaur: dName] looking at you. The [dName] lets out a [adjective] cry and charges towards you. You immediately close your eyes. After a few moments, you risk opening your eyes, only to find that you’re no longer in the jungle. At first, all you see is black, so you move your head around, and notice a [adjective] white, rocky surface is beneath you. You keep looking around, until you notice a large blue and white sphere like object in the sky. Wait a second…you’re on the [noun]! As soon as you start to explore, you immediately notice the low gravity and perform some [adjective] stunts that would have been impossible for you on Earth. Again, suddenly and without warning, your surroundings fade to white, and your friend instructs you to remove the headset. That experience was unlike anything you’ve ever experience, it was truly [adjective].
