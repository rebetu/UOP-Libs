An Errand	
	As you leave class, Professor [professor: pName] calls out to you,
 “Oh, before you leave [your name:: yName] can you send this message to 
Professor Cliburn in Anderson 115?” You were planning on getting some 
[food::fName] at the UC after your meeting, but the professor was rather
 helpful to you, so you decide to oblige his request. As you head towards
 Anderson, you notice a colleague walking towards you. “Oh, [yName]! I’m 
glad I caught you. I was on my way over to CTC, but I forgot my ID… can 
you let me in to CTC?” You look at your colleague’s [adjective] face and
 have no choice but to aid him; you walk back to CTC and let your colleague
 in. “Oh, thanks John, you’re a [noun]!”, your colleague says with a 
comforted face. You start walking back to Anderson. You enter Anderson
 and see many students working on the computers there, but you don’t see
 Professor Cliburn. Another one of your colleagues recognizes you and calls
 you over. “Hey John, do you know anything about [major related subject]?” 
You do happen to know a little bit about [major related subject : mSubject];
 but you must give Professor Cliburn that message, so you tell your colleague
 your task. “Oh, he was just here a couple minutes ago, maybe you can help me
 while you wait for him to come back” she says with [adjective] [animal] eyes.
 You half-heartedly agree. After thirty minutes of helping your colleague learn
 the basics of [mSubject]; Professor Cliburn returns. You quickly confront him 
to deliver the message. “Oh thanks, [yName]. Hey, before you go can you…” You 
cut him off “Sorry professor, there’s somewhere I need to be..” before anyone 
can stop you, you rush off to the UC to get your [fName].
