Best Day
	Let me tell you the story of my best day here at the University. So, one day, in my first year here at UOP, I was heading over to the UC to get a breakfast burrito before [Class::cName] class. I love the breakfast burritos here, I usually get mine with [food1], [food2], and [food3], so tasty. Anyway, after getting my breakfast burrito, I sat down and started munching away, thinking about what I would do for the rest of the day. It was then that I suddenly remembered there was a test scheduled for [cName], and I had completely forgotten to study for it. I [verb ending in –ed]. I briefly considered   just skipping the class and making up some [adjective] excuse, saying I was sick or something.   So, I gobbled up the rest of my breakfast burrito and rushed to class, hoping to get in a few extra minutes of study time. I ran [adverb] towards my next class, almost pushing over a poor [noun] on my way there. However, when I arrived, the class was completely empty. I gazed upon the clock, and it was 10 minutes til’; so where was everyone? I checked my phone to confirm the time; it was accurate. So I waited in class for a short while, but no one came; so I checked my [preferred mobile device], and saw an e-mail sent last night that said class was canceled, and that the test would be pushed back to next class. I started dancing the [name of popular dance/move], I was so happy. The rest of my day was free, so I decided this would be as good a time as any to study [cName] at the Library. After a few hours of studying, I felt really confident that I knew the material, so I packed up my things and headed out the door, but as I was leaving, one of the members of [Fraternity/Sorority] from my math class came up to me. “Hey, you’re [Your Name], right? Do you want to go to a party at [Place on Campus] later today?” I had nothing better to do, so I agreed to their invitation. That party was one of the best parties I’ve ever been to, and I made some friends with people I probably would never have got the chance to [verb] otherwise. I still look back on that day, feeling [emotion], it was day I will always remember.
