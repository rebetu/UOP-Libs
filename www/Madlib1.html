	  	Let me tell you the story of my best day here at the University. So, one day, in my first year here at UOP, I was heading over to the UC to get a breakfast burrito before {{data.aclass}} class. I love the breakfast burritos here, I usually get mine with {{data.food1}}, {{data.food2}}, and {{data.food3}}, so tasty. Anyway, after getting my breakfast burrito, I sat down and started munching away, thinking about what I would do for the rest of the day. It was then that I suddenly remembered there was a test scheduled for {{data.aclass}}, and I had completely forgotten to study for it. I {{data.pasttenseverb}}. I briefly considered just skipping the class and making up some {{data.adjective}} excuse, saying I was sick or something. So, I gobbled up the rest of my breakfast burrito and rushed to class, hoping to get in a few extra minutes of study time. I ran {{data.adverb}} towards my next class, almost pushing over a poor {{data.noun}} on my way there. However, when I arrived, the class was completely empty. I gazed upon the clock, and it was 10 minutes til’, so where was everyone? I checked my phone to confirm the time, it was accurate. So I waited in class for a short while, but no one came. I then checked my {{data.phone}} and saw an e-mail sent last night that said class was canceled, and that the test would be pushed back to next class. I started dancing the {{data.dancemove}}, I was so happy. The rest of my day was free, so I decided this would be as good a time as any to study {{data.aclass}} at the Library. After a few hours of studying, I felt really confident that I knew the material, so I packed up my things and headed out the door, but as I was leaving, one of the members of {{data.greekorg}} from my math class came up to me. “Hey, you’re {{data.username}}, right? Do you want to go to a party at {{data.place}} later today?” I had nothing better to do, so I agreed to their invitation. That party was one of the best parties I’ve ever been to, and I made some friends with people I probably would never have got the chance to {{data.verb}} otherwise. I still look back on that day, feeling {{data.emotion}}, it was day I will always remember.
