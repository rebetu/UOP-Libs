Worst Day 
	Let me tell you the story of my worst day here at the University. One day, back when I was a freshman, I was on my way to get some food from the UC, and out of nowhere, it started raining [animal (plural)] and [animal(plural)].  I didn’t expect that there would be rain that day, so I didn’t bring my [noun], so, I got totally soaked by all the rain. When I went in to the UC to get my breakfast, soaking wet mind you, I saw that the breakfast burrito place was closed. I always get breakfast burritos for breakfast, and I wasn’t really in the mood to eat something else. So I just decided to get some coffee from the coffee place and eat later. Unfortunately, there was a really long line at the coffee place, so I had to wait ten whole minutes before I could order my coffee. At this rate I was going to be late to class, so as soon as my order was ready, I grabbed my coffee, and [verb ending in ed] to my next class as [adverb]as I could, in hopes that I would make it just in time. As I was hurrying my way to class, I ran over a metal plating, and slipped; spilling the [adjective] coffee all over my favorite pants. “[interjection:: inj1]”, I thought, “Just [inj1]”. So, I picked myself up, feeling the pain from the bruises on my knees, the heat from the coffee all over my pants, and I [verb ending in ed] myself to class; the rain getting stronger and stronger as I crept on. When I got to class, I saw everyone working on what looked to be a test. [interjection]! I thought to myself. I forgot there was a test today. [name of professor: pname] noticed me and asked, “Can I help you?” in a [adjective] tone. I pleaded with the professor to let me take the exam, or at least a makeup exam sometime later, but [pname] just shrugged and said “You know my policy for being tardy to an exam, you don’t get the grade, sorry.” I felt like bursting in to tears right there, I was so [emotion]. I was too weary to fight the professor anymore on this, and with the luck I was having, I thought it would be better to just head back to my dorm before things got worse, as the rain continued to [verb]. When I got to my dorm, I realized I forgot my ID, so I had to wait thirty minutes before someone could let me in. I skipped the rest of my classes that day, and just [verb past tense] in my bed, waiting for the day to finally be over.
